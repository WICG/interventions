# Interventions

This repository is an archive whose issue tracker contains historical discussions about a certain type of specification change proposal, known as an "intervention".

Interventions were a category of spec proposal that intentionally changed long-standing web behavior, with the goal of providing user benefit. You can find many examples of such changes in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/WICG/interventions/issues?q=is%3Aissue), or learn more about the historical project in [older revisons of this README](https://github.com/WICG/interventions/blob/5c5e02cebfa469a31777ccfba39c846bd96f5fa6/README.md).

Since the idea was originally proposed, the community has moved away from categorizing spec changes as "interventions" or "non-interventions". Many spec changes have some ingredient of changing existing behavior, or of providing user benefit. We found that the concept of interventions as a separate category sometimes confused people, leading them to think that intervention spec-changes did not follow the normal process for standardizing and shipping new proposals. (This was never the intent.)

Similarly, we are no longer coordinating around such changes in this repository. Instead, we tend to submit specification change proposals to the relevant specification's repository, for discussion directly with that community.
