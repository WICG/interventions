      <p>
        Changes in DOM elements above the visible region of a scroller can result
        in the page moving while the user is in the middle of consuming the content.
      </p>
      <p>
        This spec proposes a mechanism to mitigate this jarring user experience by
        keeping track of the position of an anchor node and adjusting the scroll
        offset accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        This spec also proposes an API for web developers to opt-out of this behavior.
      </p>

    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Today, users of the web are often distracted by content moving around due to
        changes that occur outside the viewport. Examples include script inserting an
        iframe containing an ad, or non-sized images loading on a slow network.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically the browser's default behavior has been to preserve the absolute
        scroll position when such changes occur. This means that to avoid shifting
        content, the webpage can attempt to reserve space on the page for anything
        that will load later. In practice, few websites do this consistently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scroll anchoring aims to minimize surprising content shifts. It does this by
        adjusting the scroll position to compensate for the changes outside the
        viewport.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section dfn-for="ScrollAnchoring">
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Scroll anchoring works by selecting a DOM node (the <dfn>anchor node</dfn>) whose
        movement is used to determine the adjustment to the scroll position.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Anchor Node Selection</h3>
        <p>
          The user agent aims to select an anchor node that is deep in the DOM and close to the top
          edge of the <a id="ref-for-viewport-1">viewport</a>. This maximizes the amount of offscreen content whose
          changes the user agent will successfully compensate for, while avoiding undesired scrolling
          when important content loads within the viewport (for example, upon clicking a
          "Read More" link).
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn id="anchoring-algorithm">algorithm to select an anchor node for a scrollable area </dfn>(either a
          document or an element with scrollable overflow) is as follows:
          <ol>
            <li>Walk the DOM within the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#scrolling-box">scrollable area</a>.</li>
            <li>
              For each element E encountered by the walk
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If E is an <a href="#unsuitable-anchor" id="ref-for-unsuitable-anchor-1">unsuitable anchor node</a>, skip over E and its descendents.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Otherwise, compare its bounds to the scrollable area's visible region.
                  <ol>
                    <li>If E is <a id="ref-for-fully-visible-1">fully visible</a>, terminate the walk and use E as the anchor node.</li>
                    <li>If E is <a id="ref-for-fully-clipped-1">fully clipped</a>, skip over E and its descendents.</li>
                    <li>
                      If E is <a id="ref-for-partially-visible-1">partially visible</a>, mark it as a "candidate"
                      and descend into its children. If the walk reaches the end of E without finding
                      another anchor node, use E as the anchor node. (Deeper nodes are preferred
                      in this case to avoid the failure mode of content being inserted
                      inside the anchor node but outside the viewport.)
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn id="viewport"> viewport</dfn> is the visible region of the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#scrolling-box">scrollable area</a>.

      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Scroll Adjustment</h3>
        <p>
          When the anchor node moves, the browser computes its previous location L0 and
          its new location L1 in the coordinate space of the scrolling content. It then
          reads the current scroll position S0 and computes a new scroll position S1:
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre>S1 = S0 + (L1 - L0)</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          By setting the scroll position to S1 at the same time that the anchor node moves
          to L1, the location of the anchor node relative to the viewport is preserved, and
          no "jump" is visible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The anchor node may be either a text node or an element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conceptually, a new anchor node is computed whenever the scroll position
          changes. (As a performance optimization, the implementation may wait until the
          anchor node is needed before computing it.)
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          In some cases, a scroll anchoring adjustment is suppressed, even though
          the anchor node has moved. These are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              When 20 consecutive scroll anchoring adjustments have already occurred
              (with no intervening non-anchoring scrolls).
            </li>
            <li>
              When the scroll anchoring adjustment that would occur is the exact
              inverse of the most recent scroll anchoring adjustment, and is
              identical to the one before that. For example, given the following
              movements of the anchor node:
              <ol>
                <li>50 px downward
                <li>50 px upward
                <li>50 px downward
              </ol>
              The first two will produce scroll anchoring adjustments, but the
              third will not.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>

      <h2>Opt-out API</h2>
      <p>
        Scroll anchoring aims to be the default mode of behavior when launched, so that
        users benefit from it even on legacy content. Scroll anchoring can be disabled in
        part or all of a webpage using a CSS property <code>overflow-anchor</code> which
        applies to scrollable elements and supports the following values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <code>overflow-anchor: visible</code> causes a scrollable area to follow the content
            within its viewport, using the <a href="#anchoring-algorithm" id="ref-for-anchoring-algorithm-1">scroll anchoring algorithm</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>overflow-anchor: none</code> causes a scrollable area to maintain its absolute
            scroll position when content changes. This was the default behavior prior to
            the introduction of scroll anchoring.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>overflow-anchor: auto</code> invokes the user agent's default behavior for the
            scrollable area. With the launch of scroll anchoring this will be equivalent
            to <code>visible</code>, but is subject to future modification.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The behavior of the document-level scrollable area is based on the computed
        <code>overflow-anchor</code> style of the viewport-defining element (<code>html</code> or <code>body</code>).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>overflow-anchor</code> property is also proposed (with different values) for
        [CSS Sticky Scrollbars](http://tabatkins.github.io/specs/css-sticky-scrollbars/).
        This feature is distinct from scroll anchoring, but shares the notion of
        adjusting scroll position in response to content changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>overflow-anchor</code> property is not inherited.
